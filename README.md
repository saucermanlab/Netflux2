# Netflux2
Netflux2 is a tool for modeling biological networks, in Python. *It is in early phases of development*, with a current focus of replicating features in the original Netflux, which is based in MATLAB.

## Planned features
Accessing all main features of Netflux from a Python-only environment
Running Netflux2 from notebooks
Webapp to replace the original MATLAB GUI from Netflux

## What works right now
Use test_exampleNet.py to load exampleNet.xls, exporting Python ODE files. Then simulate the model with exampleNet_run.py to get this result:
